## A platform for Universities exams
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how an exam platform could be implemented to help people practice for university entrance exams. The platform is based on a web application that allows collaborators (people authorized by the administrator) to create questions and explanations for the exams, and students to practice the exams and check their results. It also provides information about the universities and the exams.
